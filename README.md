# Course: Python For Economics

## Course Object

The goal of this course is to develop a broad and innovative Python toolbox for empirical economists. Python is extremely versatile, and therefore
we want to focus on learning new skills and applications, rather than reproducing tasks other programming languages might also do more or less.
Things we could use as empirical researchers, and which are not so readily available
in other packages.

This includes

* Access to online data sources through API interaction and web scraping;

* Rreparing, handling and analyzing (very) large datasets and databases;

* Interactive statistics and graphs for teaching and presentation through Python notebooks;

* Object oriented programming and efficien t and scalable coding;

* Introduction to machine learning;

Since learning a language requires a lot of practice, the course is set up to be learning by
doing. And since this is a completely voluntary course, we jointly learn by doing.

## Reading Group Format

Learn together, ask help, get help, give help. How to format? e.g. everyone does lectures at home and then discuss in class? share code,
do Kaggle competitions together.

* 2/3h per week at home preparation;

* Every week. 2 hours per week.

* Everyone brings own computer + has done his/her homework

* Install same ...?

* Need to learn: otherwise we lose in 10 years as researchers.

* One manager per meeting: give 5

* 10 slides summary of last week’s videos and present first his/her results of exercises.


Then, in terms of practicalities, I think we should

* Have someone prepare and present a “chapter” or topic with shared code and data for everyone to follow in a
joint meeting

* Make sure we do some exercises ourselves individually, and be able to discuss progress and problems in
group by the next meeting.

* Think of time span and intervals: e.g. every week or 2 weeks? How long? Keep going if we have a good
group?
